description: Migrating to Gloo 1.4.x+
---

If upgrading open-source Gloo, follow the [instructions for upgrading to 1.3.x]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/1.3.0/" >}}). Simply substitute the desired 1.4.x version in place of the provided 1.3.x versions.

Upgrading Gloo Enterprise also follows the 1.3.x upgrade process with the following additions.

If upgrading from any version of Gloo Enterprise prior to 1.4.0 to Gloo Enterprise 1.4.0 or later, 
you must delete the apiserver-ui service to avoid more breaking changes:
```
kubectl delete service -n gloo-system apiserver-ui
```

Also relevant if you are upgrading from a version prior to 1.4.0, if you are running the proxy on the `hostNetwork`
and using a port lower than 1024, you will now need to explicitly enable the addition of the `NET_BIND` capability.
This can be configured as helm value, similar to:
```
gloo:
  gatewayProxies:
    gatewayProxy:
      podTemplate:
        disableNetBind: false
```
